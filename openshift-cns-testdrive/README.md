# OpenShift and Container Storage for Administrators
This repository contains lab instructions and related supporting content for
an administrative-focused workshop that deals with OpenShift and OpenShift
Container Storage.

## Requirements / Prerequisites
Doing these labs on your own requires a few things.

### AWS
These labs are designed to run on top of an OpenShift 4 cluster that has been
installed completely by the new installer. You will need access to AWS with
sufficient permissions and limits to deploy the 3 masters, 4-6 regular nodes,
and NVME-equipped nodes for storage.

Check out the
[documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/welcome/index.html)
for _Installing on AWS_.

### OpenShift 4
At this time an OpenShift 4 cluster can be obtained by visiting
https://try.openshift.com -- a free "subscription" to / membership in the
developer program is required.

## Deploying the Lab Guide
Deploying the lab guide will take three steps. First, you will need to get
information about your cluster. Second, you will build a container based on your lab.
Third, you will deploy the lab guide using the information you found so that proper
URLs and references are automatically displayed in the guide.

### Required Environment Variables
Most of the information can be found in the output of the installer.

#### Explaination and examples
- `API_URL` - URL to access API of the cluster
    - `https://api.cluster-gu1d.sandbox101.opentlc.com:6443`
- `MASTER_URL` - Master Console URL
    - `http://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-gu1d.sandbox101.opentlc.com`
- `KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for `kubeadmin`
- `SSH_PASSWORD` - password for ssh into bastion
- `ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN` - Subdomain that apps will reside on
    - `apps.cluster-gu1d.sandbox101.opentlc.com:6443`
    - `apps.mycluster.company.com`

Specific to Red Hat internal systems
- `GUID` - GUID
    - `gu1d`
- `BASTION_FQDN` - Bastion Domain Name
    - `bastion.gu1d.sandbox101.opentlc.com`

Create a file called `workshop-settings.sh` using the values of your environment. Here is an example.

> :warning: For `export` ensure [special characters](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/SpecialCharacters) are escaped (ie. use `\!` in place of `!`).

```bash
API_URL=https://api.openshift4.example.com:6443
MASTER_URL=https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift4.example.com
KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD=IqJK7-o3hYR-ZTr6c-7sztN
SSH_USERNAME=lab-user
SSH_PASSWORD=apassword
BASTION_FQDN=foo.bar.com
GUID=XXX
ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN=apps.openshift4.example.com
HOME_PATH=/opt/app-root/src
```

### Deploy the Lab Guide

Now that you have the `workshop-settings.sh` file with the various required variables, you can deploy the lab guide into your cluster.

First, clone the repo

> **NOTE** Remember to checkout the branch you want to test against

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-cns-testdrive
```

Next, Build a container using the repo/branch you checked out.

```shell
cd openshift-cns-testdrive
export QUAY_USER=myusername
export BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
podman build -t quay.io/${QUAY_USER}/lab-sample-workshop:${BRANCH} .
```

Now, login to quay (it's free to sign up) or another registry your cluster has access to.

```shell
podman login quay.io
```

Next push your container to your repo.

```shell
podman push quay.io/${QUAY_USER}/lab-sample-workshop:${BRANCH}
```

You will use this image to deploy the lab. The following command will log you in as `kubeadmin` on systems with `oc` client installed:

```bash
oc login -u kubeadmin -p $KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD

oc new-project lab-ocp-cns

# This part is needed if you're running on a "local" or "self-provisioned" cluster
oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin kube:admin -n lab-ocp-cns

# Create deployment.
oc new-app -n lab-ocp-cns https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/development/ansible/roles/ocp4-workload-workshop-admin-storage/files/production-cluster-admin.json \
--param TERMINAL_IMAGE="quay.io/${QUAY_USER}/lab-sample-workshop:${BRANCH}" --param PROJECT_NAME="lab-ocp-cns" \
--param WORKSHOP_ENVVARS="$(cat ./workshop-settings.sh)"

# Wait for deployment to finish.

oc rollout status dc/dashboard -n lab-ocp-cns
```

If you made changes to the container image and want to refresh your deployed Homeroom quickly, execute this:

```shell
oc import-image -n lab-ocp-cns dashboard
```

## Doing the Labs
Your lab guide should deploy in a few moments. To find its url, execute:

```bash
oc get route dashboard -n lab-ocp-cns
```

You should be able to visit that URL and see the lab guide. From here you can
follow the instructions in the lab guide.

## Notes and Warnings
Remember, this experience is designed for a provisioning system internal to
Red Hat. Your lab guide will be mostly accurate, but slightly off.

* You aren't likely using `lab-user`
* You will probably not need to actively use your `GUID`
* You will see lots of output that references your `GUID` or other slightly off
  things
* Your `MachineSets` are different depending on the EC2 region you chose

But, generally, everything should work. Just don't be alarmed if something
looks mostly different than the lab guide.

Also note that the first lab where you SSH into the bastion host is not
relevant to you -- you are likely already doing the exercises on the host
where you installed OpenShift from.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure you are logged-in as kubeadmin when creating the project

If you are getting _too many redirects_ error then clearing cookies and
re-login as kubeadmin. This usually happens if you're using RHPDS and
stopped/started a cluster.

## Cleaning up
To delete deployment run
```
oc delete all,serviceaccount,rolebinding,configmap -l app=admin -n labguide
```
