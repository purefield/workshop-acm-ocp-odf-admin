### Node Maintenance

It is possible to put any node of the OpenShift environment into maintenance by
marking it as non-schedulable followed by a _drain_ of all pods on the node.

These operations require elevated privileges. Ensure you are logged in as
cluster admin:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc login -u kubeadmin -p {{ KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD }}
----

You will see by now that there are pods running on almost all of your nodes:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
----

Sometimes you might need to perform maintenance on a host. Let's take a look
at the *Pods* that are on `node02`:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm manage-node --list-pods {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}
----

Firstly, we probably want to ensure that no new workload can be put on this
host. Mark node `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}` as non-schedulable to prevent the
schedulers in the system to place any new workloads on it:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --schedulable=false
----

The output of the command will show that the node is now not schedulable:

----
NAME                                          STATUS                     ROLES     AGE       VERSION
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
----

Marking the node as non-schedulable did not impact the pods it is running. List those
pods:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --list-pods
----

Other than a *Pod* for Container Native Storage and a Fluentd instance (there is
one on every node), there may or may not be other *Pods* running on this node.

The next step is to drain the *Pods* to other nodes in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Pods* running on the node as part of a `DaemonSet` like those associated to
Logging or OCS will *not* be drained. They will not be accessible anymore
through OpenShift, but will continue to run as containers on the nodes until the
local OpenShift services are stopped and/or the node is shutdown. This is not a
problem since software like OCS is designed to handle such situations transparently.
====

Start the drain process like this:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm drain {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --ignore-daemonsets
----

After a few moments, all of the *Pods*, except those for Fluentd, Container
Native Storage, and Prometheus previously running on `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN
}}` should have terminated and been launched elsewhere.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --list-pods
----

The node `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}` is now ready for an administrator to
start maintenance operations. If those include a reboot of the system or
upgrading OpenShift components, the *Pods* associated with
OCS and logging will come back up automatically.

Now that our maintenance is complete, the node is still non-schedulable. Let's
fix that:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --schedulable=true
----

Now the node will be able to have workload scheduled on it again:

----
NAME                                          STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready     compute   1h        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
----
